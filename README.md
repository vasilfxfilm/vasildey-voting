# Vasildey Voting
Simple &amp; lightweight Discord bot for running moderator elections, containing an application-submitting and voting system. 

To run the bot, simply download the source code and install it with:
```npm install```

When it finishes, you can run the code with:
```node bot```

Feel free to use my code without crediting me, I don't mind lol
